/**
 * C:N ratio is the percentage of organic carbon divided by the percentage of total nitrogen in organic material. We specify the organic material as either the above ground biomass of an herbaceous plant or the above ground herbaceous material of a woody plant. Our relative values correspond to these numerical ranges: Low: <23; Medium: 23 â€“ 59; High: >59.
