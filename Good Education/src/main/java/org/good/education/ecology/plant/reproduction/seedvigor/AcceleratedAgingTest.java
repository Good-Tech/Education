 * The principle of this test is to stress seeds with high temperatures of (40-45°C/130-139°F) and near 100% relative
 * humidity (RH) for varying lengths of time, depending on the kind of seeds, after which a germination test is made.
 * High vigor seeds are expected to tolerate high temperatures and humidity and retain their capability to produce
 * normal seedlings in the germination test.
 * <p/>
 * When can the AAT test be used?
 * <p/>
 * Can be used to determine the seed vigor of many crops.
 * Useful in predicting the potential storability of a seed lot.
