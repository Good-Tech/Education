/**
 * A hardiness zone (a subcategory of Vertical Zonation) is a geographically defined area in which a specific
 * category of plant life is capable of growing, as defined by climatic conditions, including its ability to
 * withstand the minimum temperatures of the zone (see the scale on the right or the table below). For example,
 * a plant that is described as "hardy to zone 10" means that the plant can withstand a minimum temperature of -1°C.
 * A more resilient plant that is "hardy to zone 9" can tolerate a minimum temperature of -7°C. First developed for
 * the United States by the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the use of the zones has been adopted by other nations.
