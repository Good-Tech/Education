 * Bunch:
 * Plant development by intravaginal tillering at or near the soil surface without production of rhizomes or stolons.

 * Colonizing:
 * A plant that is likely to behave as a colonizer when planted to enhance soil stabilization.
 * <p/>
 * Multiple Stems:
 * Plant development by producing two or more stems. Examples: roundleaf dogwood (Cornus rugosa) and red
